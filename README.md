Dotfiles
========

A repository holding my dotfiles, most notably my vim configuration.

Installation
============

The `install.pl` file will symlink the dotfiles to your home directory. Make sure it is run from the 'dotfiles' directory. I recommend running with the `-i` flag, because some of the files (like .gitconfig) aren't useful to anyone but me.

The script will also download and run [Vundle][1] to install the vim plugins.
