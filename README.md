Dotfiles
========

A repository holding my dotfiles, most notably my vim configuration.

Installation
============

The `install.pl` file will symlink the dotfiles to your home directory. Make sure it is run from the 'dotfiles' directory.

The script will also download and run [Vundle][1] to install the vim plugins.
